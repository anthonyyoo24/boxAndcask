## Purpose

I wanted to take a step into the e-commerce domain because I believe it is playing an important role in the transition of the global economy towards a more digital and remote configuration. Given the current lockdown measures taken in response to the coronavirus pandemic, this process should accelerate. Therefore, it seems like the online retail industry will have to carry a lot of the burden in keeping todayâ€™s economies afloat while these unfavorable conditions continue to persist. Sharing in that responsibility is something I can get behind.
